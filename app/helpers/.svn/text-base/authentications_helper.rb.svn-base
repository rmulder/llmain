module AuthenticationsHelper
  ### devise_helpers
  ## Inside your protected controller
  ## before_filter :authenticate_user!

  ## Inside your controllers and views
  ## user_signed_in?
  ## current_user
  ## user_session
  ## user_session is a hash scoped only to the user. So if you have two roles, they will have different session hashes and their data wonâ€™t conflict! This awesome feature come straights from Warden!
